# **App Name**: TaskBoard

## Core Features:

- Categorized Task Display: Displays tasks categorized as 'Home', 'Work', or 'Miscellaneous' on virtual sticky notes.
- Category-Based Color Coding: Highlights each task's sticky note based on its category (Home: Pink, Work: Yellow, Miscellaneous: Green).
- Dynamic 'Add Task' Button: Allows users to add tasks via an 'Add Task' button, which appears after the latest task added to ensure smooth user flow.
- Persistent Local Storage: Saves created tasks and labels using local storage in the browser, which allows the page to persist state.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light green (#B2FFB2) for an approachable, supportive feel. The color references office supplies, without being too close to yellow. Avoids the standard 'productivity app' blue, instead.
- Background color: Off-white (#F0F0F0) to simulate a whiteboard for task display.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#D0BFFF) to draw the eye and hint at creativity.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font that brings a mix of contemporary design and friendly warmth suitable for task descriptions and headers.
- Simple, clean icons for task categories. No icon library is specified; pick easy-to-distinguish icons that read well on colored backgrounds.
- Tasks displayed from left to right in a clear sequence, mimicking the linear nature of a to-do list.
- Gentle fade-in animations for new tasks being added.
